# CONTEXT.md

## Project Overview
This project is a modernized Flutter Minesweeper game, with a focus on robust game logic, test coverage, and future integration with ML features. The codebase is being updated for null safety, modern Flutter best practices, and maintainability.

## Current Goals
- Ensure all core game logic is bug-free and well-tested
- Use deterministic boards for all logic/unit/integration tests
- Track all bug fixes, test improvements, and code coverage requirements in TODO.md
- Prepare for future ML integration and advanced analytics

## Workflow
- All tasks, bugs, and improvements are tracked in `TODO.md`.
- As you work, update `TODO.md` to reflect progress, add new tasks, and mark completed items.
- Use this CONTEXT.md to quickly onboard new contributors or recall project state between sessions.
