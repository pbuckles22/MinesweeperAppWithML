# TODO List for Minesweeper Game Modernization & Bug Fixing

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

- [x] **Review and fix all known game logic bugs (cascade logic, flag toggling, win/loss detection, etc.) using deterministic tests.**
- [x] **Implement classic Minesweeper chording (right-click) functionality.**
- [x] **Add comprehensive edge case tests for all game scenarios.**
- [x] **Ensure code coverage is high for all core game logic, including edge cases and error handling.**
- [x] **Track and mark off each bug fix and test improvement as completed in this TODO list.**
- [x] **Fix Android APK build issues** - Resolved with Java 17 and Kotlin DSL
- [x] **Implement First Click Guarantee (Kickstarter Mode)** - First click always reveals a cascade
- [x] **Add game configuration validation** - Compile-time duplicate detection for game modes
- [x] **Fix bomb explosion display** - Clear visual distinction for different cell states
- [x] **Improve settings UX** - Consistent auto-close behavior and educational tooltips
- [x] **Add auto-generated descriptions** - Game mode descriptions from grid dimensions
- [x] **Identify classic Minesweeper 50/50 scenarios (two cells with equal probability)**
- [x] **Add visual indicators for 50/50 scenarios**
- [x] **Add tests for 50/50 detection and handling (all known scenarios covered)**

## üöß Current Status

**All core Minesweeper functionality is now working with comprehensive test coverage (237+ tests).**

### ‚úÖ Recent Test Improvements:
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests** - Added tests for constants, icon utils, haptic service, game over dialog, fifty fifty detector, game state, board square, and feature flags
- **Integration Tests** - Full game flow integration tests with performance validation
- **Performance Tests** - Large board initialization, cascade reveal, rapid moves, memory usage, win detection, chord operations, and statistics calculation
- **First Click Guarantee Tests** - Feature flag tests, cascade guarantee tests, edge cases, and settings provider tests
- **Game Logic Integration Tests** - Win and loss scenarios with deterministic boards
- **50/50 Detection Tests** - Basic detection, safe move detection, edge cases, performance tests, and scenario-based tests (currently on hold for CSP/ML integration)

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Board initialization and mine placement
- Cell revealing and cascade logic
- Flag management (toggle, validation)
- Chording (right-click) functionality
- Win/loss detection
- Game state management
- All edge cases and error handling
- Performance validation for large boards
- First Click Guarantee (Kickstarter Mode)
- Game configuration validation
- Enhanced visual feedback for game end states
- Consistent settings UX with educational tooltips

### ‚úÖ Recent Major Improvements:
- **Game Configuration Validation** - App fails to start with duplicate IDs/names
- **Bomb Display Enhancement** - Clear visual distinction between different cell states
- **Settings UX Consistency** - All game-affecting changes auto-close settings
- **Educational Tooltips** - Help icons explain game modes
- **Auto-generated Descriptions** - Reduced maintenance for game mode descriptions

## üìã Next Priority Features

### **üö® IMMEDIATE TODOs:**
1. **50/50 Situation Detection & Resolution** ‚è∏Ô∏è **ON HOLD**
   - [x] Implement detection algorithm for unsolvable situations (basic scenarios)
   - [x] Add comprehensive tests for 50/50 detection
   - [ ] **Paused for CSP/ML Integration** - Current scenario-by-scenario approach will be replaced with generalized constraint satisfaction solver
   - [ ] Consider auto-resolve or hint system for 50/50s

2. **Advanced Game Features**
   - [ ] Undo move functionality (`enableUndoMove`)
   - [ ] Hint system (`enableHintSystem`)
   - [ ] Auto-flagging (`enableAutoFlag`)
   - [ ] Best times tracking (`enableBestTimes`)

3. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - [ ] Dark mode (`enableDarkMode`)
   - [ ] Smooth animations (`enableAnimations`)
   - [ ] Sound effects (`enableSoundEffects`)
   - [ ] Enhanced haptic feedback patterns

### **üîÆ Future Features**

### **ML/AI Integration:**
- [ ] ML-powered assistance (`enableMLAssistance`)
- [ ] Auto-play functionality (`enableAutoPlay`)
- [ ] Difficulty prediction (`enableDifficultyPrediction`)
- [ ] Smart hint system using ML

### **Development Tools:**
- [ ] Debug mode (`enableDebugMode`)
- [ ] Performance metrics (`enablePerformanceMetrics`)
- [ ] Test mode (`enableTestMode`)
- [ ] Analytics and user behavior tracking

### **Advanced Game Modes:**
- [ ] Time trial mode
- [ ] Puzzle mode with predefined boards
- [ ] Multiplayer mode (future consideration)
- [ ] Tournament mode

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Advanced Game Features** - Add undo, hints, and auto-flagging
2. **UI Polish** - Dark mode and smooth animations
3. **High-Impact Test Improvements** - Focus on functional, integration, and performance tests for core game logic
4. **ML Integration Preparation** - Set up infrastructure for future ML features (including CSP/ML for 50/50 detection)
