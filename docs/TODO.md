- [x] **Add mine movement logic** - If clicked cell has a mine, move it to the other 50ell
- [x] **Update board refresh logic** - Recalculate bomb counts for affected cells after mine movement
- [x] **Integrate with existing50 detection** - Use existing detection system to identify safe move opportunities
- [x] **Add repository method** - Implement `makeSafeMove` in GameRepository interface and implementation
- [x] **Update GameProvider** - Add safe move handling with proper 50/50 situation detection
- [x] **Modify GameBoard interaction** - Use safe move when 50/50ell is clicked and safe move is enabled
- [x] **Test integration** - Verify functionality works with existing test suite (15ests passing)

### **Feature Details:**
- **User Flow**: Click on highlighted500move automatically resolves the situation
- **Mine Movement**: If clicked cell has mine, it's moved to the other 50/50 cell
- **Board Refresh**: Only affected cells have their bomb counts recalculated (minimal changes)
- **Game Continuation**: Game continues normally after safe move
- **Settings Integration**: Controlled by50/50 Safe Move" toggle in settings

## ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT PRIORITY: Feature Testing & Polish**
