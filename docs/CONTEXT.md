# CONTEXT.md

## Project Overview
This project is a modernized Flutter Minesweeper game, with a focus on robust game logic, test coverage, and future integration with ML features. The codebase is being updated for null safety, modern Flutter best practices, and maintainability.

## Current Status
- âœ… **Core game logic is fully functional** with comprehensive test coverage (260s)
- âœ… **All known bugs fixed** including cascade logic, flag toggling, win/loss detection, and 50/50 scenario detection
- âœ… **Chording functionality implemented** (right-click to reveal unflagged neighbors)
- âœ… **UI improvements completed** including zoom controls, haptic feedback, and game over dialog
- âœ… **Android build issues resolved** with Java 17 and Kotlin DSL
- âœ… **Game configuration validation implemented** with compile-time duplicate detection
- âœ… **Bomb explosion display fixed** with clear visual distinction for different cell states
- âœ… **Settings UX improved** with consistent auto-close behavior and educational tooltips
- âœ… **Auto-generated descriptions** for game modes to reduce maintenance
- âœ… **Smart Timer System** - Battery-efficient timer with app lifecycle awareness, pauses in background
- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing Strategy** - 260 tests covering all critical functionality, integration scenarios, and performance validation
- ðŸŽ¯ **50/50 Safe Move Feature** - Next development focus: implement auto-resolve functionality for 50/50 situations

## Recent Major Improvements (Latest Session)
1. **âœ… Complete Testing Strategy** - Comprehensive test suite with:
   - 260 tests passing, 34 tests skipped (50 detection on hold)
   - Complete integration testing (Settings Page, Main App, End-to-End Game Flow)
   - Performance testing for large boards and rapid interactions
   - Provider integration and widget testing
   - Error handling and edge case coverage
2. **âœ… End-to-End Game Flow Tests** - Complete simulation of user interactions:
   - Full game flow from start to win/lose
   - Game reset and restart functionality
   - Flag placement and removal
   - Difficulty changes during gameplay
3. **âœ… Provider Architecture** - Robust state management with proper integration testing
4. **âœ… Test Stability** - No more segmentation faults, reliable test execution

## Immediate TODOs (Next Session)
1. **50/50 Safe Move Implementation** - Auto-resolve 50/50 situations with user confirmation
2. **Advanced Game Features** - Implement undo, hints, and auto-flagging
3. **UI Polish** - Dark mode and smooth animations

## Current Goals
- âœ… **Testing Strategy Complete** - All high-impact tests implemented and passing
- ðŸŽ¯ **50/50 Safe Move Feature** - Implement auto-resolve functionality for 50/50 situations
- **Advanced Game Features** - Add undo, hints, and auto-flagging capabilities
- **UI/UX Enhancement** - Dark mode, animations, and sound effects
- **ML Integration Preparation** - Set up infrastructure for future ML-powered assistance

## Workflow
- All tasks, bugs, and improvements are tracked in `TODO.md`.
- As you work, update `TODO.md` to reflect progress, add new tasks, and mark completed items.
- Use this CONTEXT.md to quickly onboard new contributors or recall project state between sessions.
