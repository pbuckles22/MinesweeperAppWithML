# TODO List for Minesweeper Game Modernization & Bug Fixing

## âœ… Completed Tasks

- [x] **Review and fix all known game logic bugs (cascade logic, flag toggling, win/loss detection, etc.) using deterministic tests.**
- [x] **Implement classic Minesweeper chording (right-click) functionality.**
- [x] **Add comprehensive edge case tests for all game scenarios.**
- [x] **Ensure code coverage is high for all core game logic, including edge cases and error handling.**
- [x] **Track and mark off each bug fix and test improvement as completed in this TODO list.**
- [x] **Fix Android APK build issues** - Resolved with Java 17 and Kotlin DSL
- [x] **Implement First Click Guarantee (Kickstarter Mode)** - First click always reveals a cascade
- [x] **Add game configuration validation** - Compile-time duplicate detection for game modes
- [x] **Fix bomb explosion display** - Clear visual distinction for different cell states
- [x] **Improve settings UX** - Consistent auto-close behavior and educational tooltips
- [x] **Add auto-generated descriptions** - Game mode descriptions from grid dimensions
- [x] **Identify classic Minesweeper 50/50 scenarios (two cells with equal probability)**
- [x] **Add visual indicators for 50/50 scenarios**
- [x] **Add tests for 50/50 detection and handling (all known scenarios covered)**

## ðŸš§ Current Status

**All core Minesweeper functionality is now working with comprehensive test coverage (123+ tests).**

### âœ… What's Working:
- Board initialization and mine placement
- Cell revealing and cascade logic
- Flag management (toggle, validation)
- Chording (right-click) functionality
- Win/loss detection
- Game state management
- All edge cases and error handling
- Performance validation for large boards
- First Click Guarantee (Kickstarter Mode)
- Game configuration validation
- Enhanced visual feedback for game end states
- Consistent settings UX with educational tooltips

### âœ… Recent Major Improvements:
- **Game Configuration Validation** - App fails to start with duplicate IDs/names
- **Bomb Display Enhancement** - Clear visual distinction between different cell states
- **Settings UX Consistency** - All game-affecting changes auto-close settings
- **Educational Tooltips** - Help icons explain game modes
- **Auto-generated Descriptions** - Reduced maintenance for game mode descriptions
