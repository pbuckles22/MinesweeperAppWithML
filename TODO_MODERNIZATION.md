### 1.3 Architecture & Code Organization
- [ ] Implement proper folder structure:
  ```
  lib/
  ├── core/

  │   ├── utils/
  │   └── errors/
  ├── data/
  │   ├── models/
  │   ├── repositories/
  │   └── datasources/
  ├── domain/
  │   ├── entities/
  │   ├── repositories/
  │   └── usecases/
  ├── presentation/
  │   ├── pages/
  │   ├── widgets/
  │   ├── providers/
  │   └── themes/
  └── main.dart
  ```
- [ ] Create proper models for game entities

- [ ] Use proper naming conventions
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging

### 3.3 Performance
- [ ] Optimize widget rebuilds
- [ ] Implement proper list virtualization
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimize image loading and caching

## 🤖 Phase 4: ML Integration Preparation

- [ ] Human vs AI mode
- [ ] AI assistance mode
- [ ] AI demonstration mode
- [ ] Training mode for ML model

## 📱 Phase 5: Platform & Deployment

### 5.1 Platform Support
- [ ] Ensure proper iOS support
- [ ] Add Android support
- [ ] Consider web support
- [ ] Add desktop support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### 5.2 Dependencies & Configuration
- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest versions
- [ ] Add proper dependency injection
- [ ] Implement proper configuration management
- [ ] Add environment-specific settings

### 5.3 Build & Deployment
- [ ] Set up proper CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add automated testing in CI
- [ ] Implement proper versioning
- [ ] Add app signing automation

## 🔒 Phase 6: Security & Privacy

### 6.1 Security
- [ ] Implement proper input validation
- [ ] Add secure storage for game data
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add security headers and configurations

### 6.2 Privacy
- [ ] Add privacy policy
- [ ] Implement data anonymization
- [ ] Add user consent mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure GDPR compliance if needed

## 📊 Phase 7: Analytics & Monitoring

### 7.1 Analytics
- [ ] Add game analytics
- [ ] Track user behavior
- [ ] Monitor ML model performance
- [ ] Add crash reporting

### 7.2 Monitoring
